"""Classes for JSON serialization of SQLAlchemy models.

The abstract base classes :class:`Serializer` and :class:`Deserializer`
can be used to implement custom serialization from and deserialization
to SQLAlchemy objects. The :class:`DefaultSerializer` and
:class:`DefaultDeserializer` provide some basic serialization and
deserialization as expected by classes that follow the JSON API
protocol.

    """A default implementation of a deserializer for resource
    identifier objects for use in relationships in JSON API documents.

    Each instance of this class should correspond to a particular
    relationship of a model.

    This deserializer differs from the default deserializer for
    resources since it expects that the input dictionary `data` to
    :meth:`__call__` contains only ``'id'`` and ``'type'`` keys.

    `session` is the SQLAlchemy session in which to look for any related
    resources.

    `model` is the SQLAlchemy model class of the relationship, *not the
    primary resource*. With the related model class, this deserializer
    will be able to use the ID provided to the :meth:`__call__` method
    to determine the instance of the `related_model` class which is
    being deserialized.

    `relation_name` is the name of the relationship being deserialized,
    given as a string. This is used mainly for more helpful error
    messages.
